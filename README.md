# HealthHelper-React

HealthHelper-React is a complete revision of a project I completed a few 
years ago. It is a simple web application that allows the user to keep 
track of the foods they eat along with associated calories, macro 
nutrients, and expenses. Whether your goal is to lose, gain, or maintain 
weight, or keep your grocery spending in check, HealthHelper can be a 
useful tool for you!
